African Countries Map Game
Welcome to the African Countries Map Game! This interactive game helps you learn and identify African countries on a map.

Project Description:
The African Countries Map Game is a fun and educational tool designed to help users learn the names and locations of 
African countries. Using the Turtle graphics library, the game displays a map of Africa and prompts users to enter the
names of countries. Correct guesses are displayed on the map, and the game provides feedback on close guesses.

Usage:

A window will open displaying a map of Africa.
Enter the name of an African country in the input box.
If your guess is correct, the country name will appear on the map at the correct location.
If your guess is close, you will receive feedback to try again.
The game continues until you have guessed all the countries or choose to exit.
