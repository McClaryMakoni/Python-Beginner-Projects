Hangman Game
Description:
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python.
The player has to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides 
feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and the player's goal is to guess the word before running out of attempts.

Key Concepts:

Random Module: Used to randomly select a word from a predefined list.
Lists and Strings: Utilized to manage the word being guessed and the player's progress.
Loops and Conditionals: Core logic for handling the guessing process, checking conditions, and updating the game state.
User Input: Collecting and validating input from the player.
Sets: Used to keep track of guessed letters to avoid repetition
